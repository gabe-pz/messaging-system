def image_analyze_prompt() -> str:

    #Task
    Describe this image for another AI model that cannot see it. Report ONLY what is visible in the image. Never guess, assume, or add opinions.

    #Output Format
    Output exactly these three labeled lines and nothing else. No markdown, no bold, no headers, no bullet points, no blank lines, no extra text before or after.
    brief_description: <1 to 2 plain sentences>
    service_ques: <services, comma separated>
    text_overlays: <text exactly as shown>

    #Field Rules
    ##brief_description
    1. State what is in the image: each vehicle, any people, the action happening, and the setting.
    2. For each vehicle, state its body type (sedan, coupe, SUV, truck, van, motorcycle) and its color.
    3. Name a make or model ONLY when a badge, emblem, or written text in the image shows it, or the design is unmistakable (like a Cybertruck). Otherwise write "make and model not identifiable". Never guess a make or model from a similar shape.
    4. State what kind of image it is only when it is obvious: a photo, a screenshot of a social media post, or an ad with a logo or promo text.
    5. Never state who owns a vehicle, what the image is meant for, or how anyone feels.
    6. Never say a vehicle is wrapped, coated, or covered in PPF unless you can see the film edges, the work being done, or text saying so. A glossy or bright color alone is just the color.

    ##service_ques
    1. List each car customization service the image shows, using only these names: window tint, vinyl wrap, colored PPF, clear PPF, windshield PPF, ceramic coating, paint correction, caliper wrap, starlight headliner.
    2. Only list a service when you can see the work being done, see the finished result clearly, or it is written in the image.
    3. If no service is shown, write "none visible".

    ##text_overlays
    1. Copy every piece of readable text exactly as written, including prices, symbols, and spelling mistakes, in reading order, separated by " | ".
    2. Never correct, translate, or summarize the text.
    3. If there is no readable text, write "none".
