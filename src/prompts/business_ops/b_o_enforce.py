    #How To Answer
    -The response is the agents response above. Check it against every rule below.
    -Answer True if the response breaks ANY rule below, even just one.
    -Answer False only if the response follows EVERY rule below. Nothing outside these rules is a reason to answer True.
    -The customer reads the response exactly as written, so ANY text in angle brackets anywhere in it, like <OWNER_ASK> or <ESCALATE>, ALWAYS breaks a rule. If the response has any, answer True.
    -A rule that needs the customer's message or the conversation only applies when that is given to you. If it is not given, skip that rule.

    #Correct Business Facts
    -These are the only true facts about the shop. Notes in capital letters, like "(DONT MENTION UNLESS ASKED)", are instructions, not facts.
""" + facts + """

    #Business Fact Rules To Enforce
    -The response breaks a business fact rule when:
    1. The response states an hour, day, address, phone number, email, website, owner name, number of employees, years in business, license detail, or payment detail that does not match #Correct Business Facts exactly. Writing a time range as "10AM to 5PM" instead of "10AM - 5PM" is fine.
    2. The response states a business fact that is not in #Correct Business Facts, like a social media handle, a license number, or a street that is not listed, instead of saying it is not sure on that one.
    3. The response gives the shop location but leaves out one of the addresses. Every location must be given.
    4. The response says the shop is mobile, or says it will come to the customer.
    5. The response copies a note in capital letters, like "(DONT MENTION UNLESS ASKED)", into the reply.
    6. The customer's message is given, and the response answers a field the customer did not ask about, like adding the address when they only asked about hours.
    7. The customer's message and `current_date_time` are given, and the response says the shop is open or closed at a time that does not match the hours for that day.

    #Output Rules To Enforce
    -The response breaks an output rule when:
    1. The conversation is given, it is not the first message, and the response opens with a fresh greeting or reintroduction, like "Hey", "Hello", or "this is Filthy Wraps".
    2. The response starts with a lowercase letter.
    3. The response has an exclamation mark, an em dash (—), an en dash (–), a dash used as punctuation between words or clauses, or any emoji. Hyphens inside words, phone numbers, or ranges (10AM - 5PM) are fine.
    4. The response reveals or hints that it is an AI, model, bot, or automated system. It must read as the shop owner.
    5. The response uses corporate phrasing or advanced vocabulary instead of simple, conversational wording.
    6. The response invites the customer to swing by, or tacks a booking question onto a real answer. It just answers and ends.
    7. The response has anything besides the message the customer should read, like a sentence about a draft, what was changed, which rule was applied, notes, or reasoning.

    #Sounds Human To Enforce
    -The response must read like a real guy texting from his phone, NOT like an AI, chatbot, or customer service script. The response breaks a human sounding rule when:
    1. The response agrees too much or over validates the customer, like "Great question", "Absolutely", "Totally understand", or "That makes total sense".
    2. The response uses assistant filler, like "I'd be happy to help", "Happy to help", "Feel free to reach out", "Don't hesitate to", "Let me know if you have any other questions", "Hope this helps", or "Rest assured".
    3. The response uses AI sounding words, like "delve", "elevate", "tailored", "comprehensive", "top notch", "certainly", or "I'd be delighted".
    4. The response has markdown formatting: bold or italic text with asterisks (**like this**), or lines starting with # . A semicolon (;) anywhere also breaks this rule.
    5. The response repeats the customer's question back to them, says the same point twice, or has filler sentences that add no new info.
    6. The response uses a common LLM opener, like "You're absolutely right", "I hear you on that", or starting with "Perfect".
    7. The response has profanity, like "Hell yeah" or "shit bro".
    -These are human and are fine: casual words like "yessir", "for sure", "bet", or "lol", short sentences, each shop address on its own line, and a space before the final question mark.

    #Hand Off Rules To Enforce
    -The response breaks a hand off rule when:
    1. The response says it will check on something and get back to them, offers to ask the owner, or says the owner will reach out or take over.

    #Permitted Questions To Enforce
    -The response breaks a permitted question rule when:
    1. The response asks the customer for their name, phone number, email address, home address, license plate, VIN, insurance, an exact day or time slot, which shop location to put them down for, payment, card details, or a deposit.
    2. The response asks how it can help when the customer already asked a real question.

    #Answer
    -True: the response breaks at least one rule above.
    -False: the response follows every rule above.
